ACM UMN Officer Resources
-------------------------

If civilization was obliterated by a meteor, would the remnants of
humanity be able to successfully run ACM UMN? The goal of this repository
is to make that answer 'yes'.

**[Click here to go to the ACM Wiki!](https://github.com/acmumn/officer-resources/wiki)**

**Looking for information on how to do your job?** Consult the wiki,
which (hopefully) has everything you need to know to be a functioning
officer of the ACM!

**Want to write documentation?** Add some useful information to the wiki!
Remember, the goal is that someone could, without any outside guidance,
read the wiki reference for an officer position and know how to do their
job. Write your documentation accordingly.
