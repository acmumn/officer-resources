Hi there!

I'm a high school senior who's been to a few hackathons
(and recently, organized one of my own) from the twin cities area.
I would be 18 by the time of the event, but I was wondering
whether or not I'd be able to attend.

What is your policy regarding high school students? Would friends
of mine who are not yet 18 be able to attend?

Thanks much!

MinneHack welcomes any students of the 2016-2017 school year, including
high schoolers! If you'll be 18 by the time of the event, feel free to tell
us you are over 18 for the purposes of MinneHack. As for your colleagues
who aren't, just be sure they don't check that box so we'll have it on
record. Closer to the event we'll be sending out a waiver to the email
address they provided. In order to stay overnight they'll have to have a
parent/legal guardian fill it out and sign it.

Besides that, your registration/attendance will act exactly the same
as those in college/over 18. We're looking forward to seeing you at
MinneHack 2017!

Happy Hacking!
