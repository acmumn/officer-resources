Hi -----!

I'm -------, head of membership for ACM UMN.
If you're interested in joining, our clubroom is in Keller Hall,
room 2-204 (on the second floor). Just knock on the door and ask
if I or another ACM officer is there; we'll show you around and can
take membership fees if you're ready to join. Membership fees are $25 for
a school year or $15 for just a semester.

As for fall activities, we have both our annual Hackathon, Minnehack, as
well as our semesterly Keller LAN party coming up. Let us know
if you're interested in either, and don't hesitate to ask us any questions
you have about them.

Note that `acm@cs.umn.edu` was also a recipient of the first reply; this
lets the other officers know that the student has been replied to and
the email has been handled.
